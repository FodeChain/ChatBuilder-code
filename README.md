# ChatBuilder: LLM-assisted Modular Robot Creation

[ChatBuilder website](https://fodechain.github.io/ChatBuilder/)

We present a novel approach for modular robot design using Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent agents. We decompose the modular robot creation task and develop two agents based on LLM to plan and assemble the modular robots from text prompts. By inputting textual descriptions, users can generate robot designs that cover a wide range of design requirements. Based on this method, we propose a new text-based interactive modular robot design tool, which can lower the design barrier for non-expert users and improve design efficiency.

This project includes supplementary materials related to ChatBuilder, and the complete code will be uploaded soon.
