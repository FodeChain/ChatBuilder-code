# ChatBuilder: LLM-assisted Modular Robot Creation

[ChatBuilder website](https://fodechain.github.io/ChatBuilder/)

We present a novel approach for modular robot design using Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent agents. We decompose the modular robot creation task and develop two agents based on LLM to plan and assemble the modular robots from text prompts. By inputting textual descriptions, users can generate robot designs that cover a wide range of design requirements. This method reduces the need for manual intervention and lowers the technical barrier to creating complex robotic systems. 

This project includes supplementary materials related to ChatBuilder, and the complete code will be uploaded soon.
